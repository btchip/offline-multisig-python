{"name":"Offline multisig python","tagline":"Sign bitcoin multisig transactions (P2SH spends) from your Coinkite shared accounts, using this simple python program","body":"# Offline Signing Tool (python version)\r\n\r\nThis simple tool can be used to sign a proposed multisig transaction\r\n(P2SH spend). You must already posess the associated extended public key\r\n(BIP32 wallet). The details of the transaction to be signed can\r\neither be fetched from Coinkite (based on a very long URL, provided\r\nwith `--url` argument) or in a file, as download from the site.\r\n\r\nThe signed output (which is a small JSON file) can be uploaded\r\nmanually, but this program will by default upload the file to\r\nCoinkite.  If this new signature is the final one required, the\r\ntransaction is sent immediately.\r\n\r\n[Learn more about Coinkite's Multisig (Shared) accounts](https://coinkite.com/faq/multisig)\r\nand visit the [Coinkite Main Site](https://coinkite.com/) to open your\r\naccount today!\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n![form screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coinkite/offline-multisig-python/master/example-form.png \"Example from Coinkite.com\")\r\n\r\nSave the file you get from pressing beside the **Green** arrow, and \r\nprovide that as the `--proposal` argument.
